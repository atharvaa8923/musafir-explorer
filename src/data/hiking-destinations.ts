    longDescription: "The Triund Trek is one of the most popular weekend treks in the Himalayas, offering breathtaking panoramic views without requiring extensive trekking experience. Starting from McLeod Ganj in Dharamshala, this moderately difficult trek takes you through oak and rhododendron forests before opening up to the magnificent Triund meadow at 2,850 meters. The highlight is the spectacular 180-degree view of the Dhauladhar range on one side and the Kangra Valley on the other. This 2-day trek is perfect for beginners and offers an authentic mountain experience with overnight camping under the stars.",
