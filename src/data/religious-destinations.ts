Mount Kailash is considered the abode of Lord Shiva in Hindu tradition, the Buddha Demchok in Buddhism, and a sacred site for Jains and followers of Bon. This 13-day budget pilgrimage begins from Uttarakhand, crossing into Tibet through the Lipulekh Pass. The journey includes the sacred Parikrama (circumambulation) of Mount Kailash, covering 52 kilometers over three days, and a holy dip in Lake Mansarovar, believed to cleanse all sins.
